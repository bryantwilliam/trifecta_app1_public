# trifecta_app1_public

First demo app for Atomic.io

In the app root directory, remember to create a `.env` file with the following set:
```
API_KEY=''
API_URL=''
USER_ID=''
```

Also, remember to place the generated `jwtRS512.key` file in an assets folder in the app root directory like this: `assets/jwtRS512.key`
